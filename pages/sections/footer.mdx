# Footer Section (Coming Soon)

The Footer section will also be available in the next version of `convertfast-ui`. It provides a global footer for your landing page.

To add the Footer section manually:

```bash
npx convertfast-ui@latest page <your-page> add footer
```

## Components

Information on specific components will be available upon release.

> **Note:** The Navbar and Footer sections are not included by default when using the `page create` command, as most landing pages already have their own global navigation bars and footers. Developers can add these sections manually if needed.
