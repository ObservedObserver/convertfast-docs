# Hero Section

Hero section is default included when using `convertfast-ui page create` to create a new landing page. It is the first section that appears on the landing page and is used to grab the user's attention.

If you want to use hero section separately, you can use command

```bash
npx convertfast-ui@latest page <you-page> add hero-section
```
